This is page 5.Lisianthus
Aroma drags me out of where I was
Cream rose, stargazer, iris
Construct the map that helps me trace your steps
Zipped my mouth
I just keep climbing up, keep climbing up
Justify our vows
I know you are right above, you are right above, you are right above
Look now
I'm on the top of your world, top of your world
My darling
Here I come, I yell
And take a leap to Hell
Swirling wind sings for our reunion
And nine point eight is my acceleration
Take me to where our souls may live in peace
Our brand new commencement
Touch of your lips compassionately pressed against
The skull that you used to cherish
Delicate flesh decomposes off my rotten bones
And softly merge into the sky
This is the end of page 5.
